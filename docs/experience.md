???+ tip "Master's Thesis Student"

    ## **AbbVie Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG., Ludwigshafen, Germany**

    _Oct 2024 – Present_

    ### **AI & Machine Learning Expertise :**
    
    -> Designed, developed and deployed an AI-powered document analysis system using OpenAI’s GPT-4o and text-embedding-3-large to analyze complex, unstructured documents (text, tables, images, flowcharts).

    -> Built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline leveraging similarity search and GPT-4o to answer user queries with context-relevant, document-grounded responses.

    -> Applied prompt engineering to optimize the use of both embedding models and LLMs via API, ensuring accurate retrieval and generation.

    -> Conducted thorough benchmarking and evaluation of the AI pipeline using metrics such as Precision@3 (99%), and BERTScore (91.57%) across 100 manually curated QA pairs.

    -> Experimented with tools and models for data extraction, chunking, embedding, and QA, identifying optimal strategies for each pipeline component.

    ### **Data Engineering & Workflow Automation :**

    -> Built a robust Python-based data pipeline to:

    1. Extract content from unstructured documents using GPT-4o.

    2. Chunk content by section to preserve semantics.

    3. Generate embeddings and store them in Pinecone for vector-based retrieval.

    -> Indexed all document embeddings in Pinecone vector database, Pinecone was choosen for its fast and accurate similarity search over large document sets.

    -> Fully automated the document QA process, eliminating manual search and analysis of complex documents.

    ### **Software Development & Deployment :**

    -> Developed a multi-page, interactive Streamlit web application to:

    1. Upload and manage documents

    2. Query the system

    3. View and download retrieved document sections and AI-generated answers

    -> Built the entire application inside a Docker Dev Container, ensuring consistent environments and easier development handoff.

    -> Built a Docker image od the application for platform-independent deployment.

    -> Wrote detailed technical documentation of the system architecture, deployment guidelines, and maintenance procedures.

    ### **Real-World Impact & Business Value :**

    -> Reduced 36 hours of manual effort per month by automating the document analysis and question-answering workflow.

    -> Eliminated the risk of human error by completely automating the document analysis and question answering process.

    ### **Cross-Team Collaboration & Leadership :**

    -> Worked with technical stakeholders to understand infrastructure and deployment requirements (e.g., API access, deployment environments).

    -> Engaged with non-technical stakeholders to translate manual document review processes into a clear AI automation framework.

    -> Communicated technical architecture and project updates to both engineering teams and stakeholders from business.

???+ tip "Working Student (Full-time)"

    ## **AbbVie Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG., Ludwigshafen, Germany**

    _Apr 2023 – Sep 2023_ 

    ### **AI & Machine Learning Expertise :**
    
    -> Designed, developed and deployed a BERT-based Text Classification System to automatically extract and classify records from multiple databases at AbbVie.

    -> Conducted hands-on research on traditional ML models for text classification. Benchmarked the performance and justified BERT as the best-fit model for the particular use-case. 

    -> Models implemented: BERT, Extra Trees Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, SVM, Voting Classifiers, MLP Classifier, Gradient Boosting, SGD Classifier, Naive Bayes, KNN and Decision Trees.

    -> Optimized model accuracy through hyperparameter optimization (Grid Search), refining classification precision for the particular business use.

    -> Evaluated ML models using production datasets, ensuring no performence drop under actual deployment conditions.

    ### **Data Engineering & Workflow Automation :**

    -> Developed a Python-based data pipeline that extracted, preprocessed, and classified text data from structured and unstructured sources, completely eliminating manual triaging of records.

    -> Automated email data processing using Power Automate, eliminating the need for manual handling of incoming records.

    ### **Software Development & Deployment :**

    -> Built the application within a Docker Dev Container environment to ensure consistent development environments.

    -> Built the Docker image of the application for host independent deployment.

    -> Documented the entire architecture, providing clear guidelines for future maintenance, troubleshooting, and upgrades.

    ### **Real-World Impact & Business Value :**

    -> Reduced irrelevant information delivery to business teams by 87%.

    -> Reducing 32 hours of manual work per month.

    -> Transformed a manual, error-prone process into a fully automated AI-driven workflow hence improving efficiency and accuracy.

    ### **Cross-Team Collaboration & Leadership :**

    -> Conducted requirement gathering sessions with technical and non-technical stakeholders to understand the low level details involved in the existing manual workflow.

    -> Communicated project progress effectively to non-technical stakeholders and made AI implementation understandable at all levels.
